# Optimizing-for-Solar-Cells-Structure
This repository apply ML and heuristic algorithms for optimizing structures of tandem solar cells. In [Modeling](https://github.com/HKjoe/Optimizing-for-Solar-Cells-Structure/tree/master/Modeling) file, it include source code of building and training CPN model. Furthermore, ModelConfig.py is some configurations about CPN while training. CPN.py is main code for training model. 5to3.h5 is our trained model for replace simulation tools. WHUT_more_data.npy is simulation dataset, which includes 12500 sets.
